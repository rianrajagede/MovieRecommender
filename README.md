# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This is a simple Content-Based Movie Recommender System implemented using Python. I use a modified data from MovieLens Dataset (see `formatted_data/`).

**Please Note** I use this program to as demo when teaching content-based recommender system, so this program is not intended to be used in the production.

### Prerequisite

This program needs some package that listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

See `README` file in the `formatted_data/` folder to see the properties of the data that used in this recommender system and see `README` in the `utils/` folder to explore and understand how I modified the original dataset to create the training and test data.
